# Partition String into Unique Character Substrings

## Problem Description

Given a string `s`, the goal is to partition the string into one or more substrings such that the characters in each substring are unique. In other words, no letter should appear more than once within any single substring.

Return the **minimum number** of substrings that satisfy this condition.

Each character in the string must belong to **exactly one** substring in the final partition.
