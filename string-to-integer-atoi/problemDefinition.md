# String to Integer (atoi)

## Problem Statement

Implement the `myAtoi(string s)` function, which converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer.

The algorithm for `myAtoi(string s)` is as follows:

1. **Whitespace**: Ignore any leading whitespace (" ").
2. **Signedness**: Determine the sign by checking if the next character is '-' or '+', assuming positivity if neither is present.
3. **Conversion**: Read the integer by skipping leading zeros until a non-digit character is encountered or the end of the string is reached. If no digits were read, then the result is 0.
4. **Rounding**: If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range [-2^31, 2^31 - 1], then round the integer to remain in the range. Specifically, integers less than -2^31 should be rounded to -2^31, and integers greater than 2^31 - 1 should be rounded to 2^31 - 1.
5. Return the integer as the final result.

## Examples

### Example 1

**Input:** `s = "42"`  
**Output:** `42`  
**Explanation:**  
The underlined characters are what is read in and the caret is the current reader position.
Step 1: "42" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
^
Step 2: "42" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')
^
Step 3: "42" ("42" is read in)
